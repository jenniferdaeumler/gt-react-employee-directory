# React Homework: Employee Directory

### Overview
I created an employee directory with React. The application's UI is seperated into components, manages component state, and responds to user events.

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Description
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user is be able to sort the table by last name and email.  The user can also filter by last name.
